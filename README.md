A machine learning project that examines geolocation data and user preferences to make intelligent recommendations to clients based on their amenities and budgets.

## Description

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory analysis on geographical data using Python and machine learning algorithms, and to provide recommendations to clients based on their preferences and budget. The project uses the Foursquare API to gather data on various venues in the specified location and uses this data to build a model that can predict the amenities that clients will prefer.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Machine Learning Algorithms
* Foursquare API

## Setup

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Add your Foursquare API credentials in `config.ini`.
4. Run `main.py` using `python main.py`.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project is obtained from the Foursquare API. The API provides data on various venues, including their location, category, and user ratings.

## Results

The project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and provide recommendations to clients. The results are presented in the form of a table that shows the top recommended venues based on the client's preferences and budget.

### Top Recommended Venues

| Venue Name | Category | Rating | Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Starbucks | Coffee Shop | 4.5 | $$ |
| Chipotle Mexican Grill | Mexican Restaurant | 4.2 | $ |
| Panera Bread | Bakery | 4.1 | $$ |
| Shake Shack | Burger Joint | 4.5 | $$ |
| Sweetgreen | Salad Place | 4.4 | $$ |

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze geographical data and provide intelligent recommendations to clients based on their preferences and budget. By using the Foursquare API, we were able to gather data on various venues and build a model that can predict the amenities that clients will prefer. The results show that the model can accurately predict the top recommended venues based on the client's preferences and budget.
